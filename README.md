# Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for Portfolio Optimization


## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation and experimental results of using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for portfolio optimization. 
QAOA is a quantum algorithm that aims to solve combinatorial optimization problems, and portfolio optimization is a classic problem in finance seeking to construct an investment portfolio that maximizes returns while minimizing risk. 
The pursuit of optimal portfolio selection and optimization is a pressing endeavor, captivating researchers across classical, quantum, and hybrid methodologies. 
The complexity inherent in this pursuit stems from the dual imperative of identifying the optimal solution while contending with time constraints, especially pertinent in the realm of financial transactions.


Accurately predicting the stock market in real-time is an arduous feat, compounded by the vast volume of data and the influence of unpredictable external factors. 
Variables such as geopolitical events, natural disasters, or economic crises can dramatically impact market dynamics, defying traditional quantification methods.

## Motivation

Our project aims to leverage the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to address portfolio optimization challenges. 
By employing a quantum simulator, we seek to elucidate the behavior of QAOA on small-scale systems, facilitating benchmarking against classical methodologies. 
Subsequently, this foundational understanding will serve as a springboard for extending our approach to increasingly complex systems.

## Implementation

The implementation is done using Python programming language and leveraging the circ library for quantum computing. The key components of the implementation include:

- Construction of the portfolio optimization problem as a binary optimization task.
- Encoding the problem into a suitable form for quantum computation.
